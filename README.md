    ```

3. Run the app:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Project Structure

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** principles, organized into the following layers:

- **Data Layer**: Handles data sources and repositories.
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities.
- **Presentation Layer**: UI code, widgets, and state management using `flutter_bloc`.

### Packages Used

Here is the list of packages utilized in the project:

- **[cupertino_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino_icons)**: iOS-style icons.
- **[intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl)**: Internationalization and localization support.
- **[flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)**: Bloc for state management.
- **[get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)**: Service locator for dependency injection.
- **[dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)**: Powerful HTTP client for Dart.
- **[url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)**: Launch URLs, emails, and more.
- **[gap](https://pub.dev/packages/gap)**: Simple gap widget for spacing.
- **[cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image)**: For efficient image loading and caching.
- **[equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)**: Simplifies equality comparisons.
- **[google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)**: Access to Google Fonts.

- **[shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)**: Store simple data like user preferences locally.

### Architecture

The project is structured into three layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for the UI and state management using `flutter_bloc`.
- **Domain Layer**: Manages business logic with use cases and entities.
- **Data Layer**: Handles API calls using `dio`, caching images, and managing shared preferences for local storage.

## Usage

1. **Notification Prompt**: When the app starts, you will see an iOS-style dialog requesting notification permission. Depending on the user's response:
    - **Allow**: Navigates to the News screen.
    - **Donâ€™t Allow**: Dismisses the dialog without further action.
   
2. **News Screen**: Displays a list of news items once the user allows notifications.
